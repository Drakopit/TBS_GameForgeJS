# Turn-Based Strategy Game Example

Welcome to the **Turn-Based Strategy (TBS) Game Example** repository! This project showcases a minimalist grid-based TBS game built entirely with **pure JavaScript** using **GameForgeJS**, a custom JavaScript game development library I created.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Grid-Based Gameplay**: Inspired by classic turn-based strategy games.
- **Smooth Animations**: Optimized for performance in modern browsers.
- **Pure JavaScript**: No dependencies on Node.js, TypeScript, or external npm packages.
- **Browser-Ready**: Runs directly in any modern browser—no additional setup required.
